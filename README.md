# DeepLearning-PyTorch-ObjectDetection
Implementing object localization and detection on an augmented MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. This project showcases custom CNN architectures, specialized loss functions for bounding box prediction, and performance evaluation using accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU).
